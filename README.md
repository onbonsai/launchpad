# launchpad

A token launchpad for Lens Chain and Base.

## Overview

Launchpad is a Next.js app for creating and launching tokens across Lens Chain and Base, with firstâ€‘class support for wallet connectivity, media, and social integrations.

## Tech stack

- Next.js 15, React 18, TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- wagmi + viem for web3
- Apollo GraphQL
- Sentry (optional)

## Quickstart

Prerequisites:

- Node.js 18.18+ (LTS recommended)
- pnpm 8+

Install and run locally:

```bash
nvm use
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Build and run production locally:

```bash
nvm use
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

## Scripts

- `pnpm dev`: Start the development server (Turbopack)
- `pnpm build`: Build the production bundle
- `pnpm start`: Start the production server
- `pnpm lint`: Run eslint
- `pnpm lint:fix`: Fix lint issues

## Environment variables

Create a `.env.local` in the repo root and set the variables you need. Many are optional; only set the ones required for the features you use. Reference `.env.example` for the required variables.

Notes:

- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_LAUNCHPAD_CHAIN_ID=8453` for production (Base mainnet). Use `84532` for Base Sepolia testnet.
- Some features (e.g., media uploads, notifications) require the corresponding keys to be present.

## Deployment

This is a standard Next.js app and deploys well on Vercel. Configure the same environment variables in your hosting provider. The build command is `pnpm build` and the output is a Next.js server.
