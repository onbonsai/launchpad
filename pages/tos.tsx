              you agree to these Terms on behalf of the entity.
              <h1 className="text-2xl mt-4">1. General</h1>
              Bonsai is not a wallet provider, exchange, broker, dealer, financial institution, payments processor,
              money services business, or creditor. Bonsai provides a peer-to-peer technical infrastructure that helps
              users discover and directly interact with each other and Tokens available on public blockchains. We do not
              have custody or control over the Tokens or blockchains you are interacting with and we do not execute or
              effectuate purchases, transfers, or sales of Tokens. To use our Services, you must use a third-party
              wallet which allows you to engage in transactions on blockchains. We reserve the right to revise these
              Terms, at any time and from time to time, for any reason in our sole discretion by any written
              announcement or notice or by publishing an updated Terms without advance notice to you (the
              "Modifications"). These changes become effective immediately and, by continuing to access or use the
              Services after they become effective, you confirm your acceptance of the Modifications and all of the
              terms incorporated therein by reference effective as of the date these Modifications. It is your sole
              responsibility to review the Terms from time to time to view such changes and to ensure that you
              understand the terms and conditions that apply when you access or use the Services.
              <h1 className="text-2xl mt-4">2. Eligibility</h1>
              <h1 className="text-xl mt-4">2.1. Age Restrictions</h1>
              You must be at least 18 years of age to use the Services. If you are under 18 but at least 13 years old,
              you may only use the Services through a parent or guardian's account and with their approval and
              oversight. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant to us that: (i) you are at least 18 years
              old; (ii) you have not previously been suspended or removed from the Services; (iii) your registration and
              your use of the Services is in compliance with any and all applicable laws and regulations; and (iv) if
              you are the parent or guardian of a user under the age of 18 (a "Minor"), that you are accepting these
              Terms on behalf of such Minor, authorizing such Minor to use the Services pursuant to the account you've
              established on the Services, and remain liable for all activities of the Minor arising out of the Minor's
              use of the Services. If you are an entity, organization, or company, the individual accepting these Terms
              on your behalf represents and warrants that they have authority to bind you to these Terms and you agree
              to be bound by these Terms.
              <h1 className="text-xl mt-4">2.2. Regulatory Compliance</h1>
              By using the Services, you represent and warrant that: (a) you are not located in, ordinarily resident in,
              or organized under the laws of any jurisdiction that is subject to a comprehensive U.S. Government embargo
              ("Embargoed Jurisdiction"); (b) you are not subject to any sanctions administered by an agency of the U.S.
              Government, any other government, or the United Nations (collectively, “Sanctions”); (c) you are not owned
              or controlled, directly or indirectly, by any person that is subject to Sanctions, or that is located in,
              ordinarily resident in, or organized under the laws of, any Embargoed Jurisdiction; (d) none of your
              officers, managers, directors, shareholders or authorized representatives is subject to Sanctions, or is
              located in, ordinarily resident in, or organized under the laws of, any Embargoed Jurisdiction, or is
              owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by any person that is subject to Sanctions or that is located
              in, ordinarily resident in, or organized under the laws of, any Embargoed Jurisdiction; (e) you have not
              transacted and will not transact with any person or entity falling into any of (a)-(d); (f) you have not
              transacted and will not transact for the benefit of any person or entity falling into any of (a)-(d). You
              further covenant that the foregoing shall be true during the entire period of your use of the Services. If
              you access or use the Services outside the United States, you are solely responsible for ensuring that
              your access and use of the Services in such country, territory or jurisdiction does not violate any
              applicable laws.
              <h1 className="text-2xl mt-4">3. Access to Our Services</h1>A blockchain wallet and a third-party wallet,
              each compatible with our Services (a “Wallet”), are required to access our Services. Your account on the
              Services (your “Account”) will be associated with the blockchain wallet address you use to connect to our
              Services. By using your third-party wallet in connection with the Services, you agree that you are using
              that wallet under the terms and conditions of the applicable provider of the wallet. Wallets are not
              operated by, maintained by, or affiliated with Bonsai, and Bonsai does not have custody or control over
              the contents of your wallet and has no ability to retrieve or transfer its contents. Bonsai accepts no
              responsibility for, or liability to you, in connection with your use of a wallet and makes no
              representations or warranties regarding how the Services will operate with any specific wallet. You are
              solely responsible for keeping your wallet secure and you should never share your wallet credentials or
              seed phrase with anyone. If you discover an issue related to your wallet, please contact your wallet
              provider. Likewise, you are solely responsible for your Account and any associated wallet and we are not
              liable for any acts or omissions by you in connection with your Account or as a result of your Account or
              wallet being compromised. You agree to immediately notify us if you discover or otherwise suspect any
              security issues related to the Services or your Account. You also represent and warrant that you will
              comply with all applicable laws in connection with using the Services. In order to comply with our legal
              obligations and keep our users and platform safe, we may need to restrict, suspend, or terminate your
              access to the Services without prior notice. You acknowledge that we are under no obligation to disclose
              the details of our decision to take such action with you. We may require you to provide additional
              information and documents in certain circumstances, such as at the request of any government authority, as
              any applicable law or regulation dictates, to provide you with a requested service, or to investigate a
              potential violation of these Terms. In such cases, we, in our sole discretion, may disable your Account
              and block your ability to access the Services until such additional information and documents are
              processed by Bonsai. If you do not provide complete and accurate information in response to such a
              request, we may refuse to restore your access to the Services. Your access and use of the Services may be
              interrupted from time to time for any of several reasons, including, without limitation, the malfunction
              of equipment, periodic updating, maintenance, or repair of the Services, geographic restrictions,
              potential violation of these Terms, or other actions that we, in our sole discretion, may elect to take.
              You understand that Bonsai, in its sole discretion, may disable your Account or restrict access through
              your Account to our Services.
              <h1 className="text-2xl mt-4">4. Services and the Bonsai Launchpad Protocol</h1>
              <h1 className="text-xl mt-4">4.1. Services and the Bonsai Protocol</h1>
              The Site allows you to (i) create your own tokens using bonding curves (in each instance, a "Token") on a
              public blockchain, and (ii) buy and sell Tokens created by you or other users on the Site. Tokens created
              on the Site utilize a bonding curve mechanism, and if sufficient participation is achieved, may graduate
              to become standard tokens. Each Token on the Site is created by a user by initiating a creation of a smart
              contract on the applicable public blockchain using the Bonsai Protocol, a bonding curve protocol that was
              developed by Bonsai and is available alongside the Services (the "Bonsai Protocol"). Once a Token is
              created, its corresponding smart contract cannot be changed by anyone, including the creator of the Token
              and Bonsai. The supply and trading dynamics of any Token follow fixed rules set by the Bonsai Protocol,
              which applies to every creator and all Tokens, and is not modifiable by any creator of the Token once the
              Token has been created. Prices of Tokens available on or created using the Services or the Bonsai Protocol
              are highly volatile. By using the Services you hereby acknowledge and agree that you understand the risks
              of interacting with Tokens, including but not limited to those described in Section 14 of these Terms, and
              are solely responsible for any funds or value resulting from your usage of the Services. The Services
              provide one method for accessing the Bonsai Protocol, but are not the only way to do so. For clarity, the
              defined term "Services" does not include the Bonsai Protocol.
              <h1 className="text-xl mt-4">4.2. Peer-to-Peer Nature of Tokens.</h1>
              Transactions occurring on the Site are peer-to-peer in nature. As such, Bonsai is not party to any
              agreement between any users. You bear full responsibility for verifying the identity, legitimacy, and
              authenticity of Tokens with which you interact using the Services and we make no claims, guarantees, or
              recommendations about the identity, legitimacy, functionality, or authenticity of users or any Tokens (and
              any content associated with such Tokens) visible on the Services. To the fullest extent permitted by
              applicable law, you release Bonsai from responsibility, liability, claims, demands, and/or damages (actual
              and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown (including claims of negligence), arising
              out of or related to disputes between users and the acts or omissions of third parties. If you are a
              consumer who resides in California, you hereby waive your rights under California Civil Code § 1542, which
              provides: “A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know
              or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or
              her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.”
              <h1 className="text-xl mt-4">4.3. Creating Tokens.</h1>
              Tokens created may not be supported or capable of being bridged to any other blockchain network. Subject
              to your complete and ongoing compliance with these Terms, Bonsai grants you a limited, non-exclusive,
              non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to access and use the Site solely for purposes of
              creating, buying, or selling Tokens. As Bonsai lacks the ability to control how a third party may use the
              Services or the Bonsai Launchapd Protocol, nothing in this Section 4 is intended to imply that the
              Services or the Bonsai Launchapd Protocol prohibits a third party from making unauthorized reproduction of
              any User Content (defined below), and the owner of any intellectual property rights in or associated with
              a Token is solely responsible for enforcement of such rights.
              <h1 className="text-xl mt-4">4.3.1. Gas Fees for Creating.</h1> There are no fees paid to Bonsai for
              creating your Tokens using the Services. However, transactions on a public blockchain require a fee to
              cover the computational resources expended to execute the transaction (the “Gas Fee”). You are responsible
              for paying the Gas Fee associated with creating a Token through the Services. Gas Fees are necessary to
              support the applicable public blockchain.
              <h1 className="text-xl mt-4">4.4. Buying and Selling Tokens.</h1> Each transaction on the Site is directly
              between the buyer and seller of the applicable Token.
              <h1 className="text-lg mt-4">4.4.1. Platform Fee.</h1> By using our Services to buy Tokens, you
              acknowledge and agree that we may collect a fee for providing the infrastructure necessary to complete the
              transaction. We reserve the right to change our fee at any time, provided that any fees then-applicable to
              your transaction will be clearly disclosed prior to the completion of such transaction. We urge you to
              carefully review the applicable fees before entering into any transaction using our Services.
              <h1 className="text-lg mt-4">4.4.2. Disputes Between Users.</h1> Bonsai will not be a party to any
              disputes or negotiations of disputes between users. You agree to resolve all such disputes with any other
              users of the Services directly and without involving Bonsai in such dispute. Responsibility for the
              decisions you make regarding Tokens offered via the Services rests solely with you. If Bonsai is required
              to participate in any such dispute, then you will indemnify, defend, and hold the Bonsai Parties (defined
              below) harmless from and against any and all damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including
              reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of any such dispute.
              <h1 className="text-xl mt-4">4.5. Rewards Programs.</h1> Bonsai, in its sole discretion, may offer your
              certain incentives and rewards for your use of the Services. In connection with such rewards, you hereby
              agree that Bonsai may publish publicly available wallet activity through the Services. The criteria for
              earning any such rewards will be determined by Bonsai in its sole discretion, and details regarding
              rewards programs will be provided on the Services as determined by Bonsai in its sole discretion. In
              connection with any rewards programs, you may be required to claim the rewards using your eligible Wallet
              during the relevant promotional period. If any rewards are not claimed during the promotional period, you
              understand and agree that such rewards may expire, and you will no longer have any right to claim such
              rewards. You agree that you are responsible for paying any and all Gas Fees and taxes that may arise out
              of rewards claimed by you. Bonsai reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to change, modify,
              discontinue, or cancel any rewards programs, at any time, without notice to you, and without any liability
              to you.
              <h1 className="text-xl mt-4">4.6. Supported Crypto Assets and Tokens.</h1>
              <h1 className="text-lg mt-4">4.6.1. General.</h1>
              The crypto assets and Tokens supported by the Services are subject to change at our sole discretion and
              without prior notice. Certain crypto assets or Tokens may be restricted from the Services for any reason,
              including but not limited to, user harm prevention, legal and regulatory compliance, and enforcement of
              these Terms. Existing support for any crypto assets or Tokens under the Services does not guarantee any
              continuous support in the future. You are solely responsible for monitoring which crypto assets or Tokens
              are supported by the Services. We are not liable for discontinuation of support of any particular crypto
              asset or Token. We reserve the right to, and by using the services you acknowledge and agree that we may,
              discontinue supporting any crypto asset or Token with or without notice. Under no circumstances will we be
              liable for any direct or indirect losses, damages, or costs that you may suffer in connection with any
              actions or inaction we may take in accordance with these Terms to discontinue our support of a crypto
              asset or Token.
              <h1 className="text-lg mt-4">4.6.2. Risks.</h1>
              There are substantial risks associated with transactions involving crypto assets, including ERC-20z
              Tokens. You should carefully evaluate whether the Services are suitable for you, considering your
              circumstances, knowledge, and financial resources. While some of these risks are outlined in Section 14
              herein, it is not an exhaustive list and may not encompass all risks associated with your use of the
              Services. By accessing and using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that you assume all risks
              associated with such actions, and we are not liable for any losses you may incur due to these risks.
              <h1 className="text-lg mt-4">4.6.3. Disclosure.</h1>
              Support of any crypto asset or Token by the Services does not constitute (i) an offer or solicitation to
              invest in, buy, or sell any interests or shares, or to participate in any investment or trading strategy,
              (ii) accounting, legal, or tax advice, or investment recommendations, or (iii) an official statement of
              Bonsai. Bonsai may have financial interests in certain crypto assets or Tokens that are supported by the
              Services. Prior to making any investment decisions, we advise that you first consult with your advisors.
              <h1 className="text-lg mt-4">4.6.4. No Representation or Warranty.</h1>
              No representation or warranty is made, expressed, or implied regarding the accuracy of the information or
              the future performance of any Token, crypto asset, financial instrument, or other market or economic
              measure. Bonsai does not endorse or approve any links or third-party websites provided through the
              Services for the purpose of facilitating user due diligence efforts, or for other educational or
              informational purposes.
              <h1 className="text-2xl mt-4">5. Digital Assets</h1>
              <h1 className="text-xl mt-4">5.1. Digital Collectibles</h1>
              Bonsai allows users to create, discover and acquire Tokens on the Services. Through our Services, users
              can create Tokens using bonding curves on the applicable public blockchain. Bonsai provides the technical
              infrastructure for users to create the smart contract on the public blockchain governing each Token
              created on the Services. Bonsai does not make any representations or warranties about Third-Party Content
              (defined below) visible through our Services, including any Content (defined below) associated with any
              images or Tokens displayed on the Services.
              <h1 className="text-lg mt-4">5.1.1.</h1> You are solely responsible for the Content associated with any
              Tokens you create. You represent and warrant that such Content does not contain material subject to
              copyright, trademark, publicity rights, or other intellectual property rights, unless you have necessary
              permission or are otherwise legally entitled to post the Content and that the Content does not violate any
              laws.
              <h1 className="text-lg mt-4">5.1.2.</h1> You are solely responsible for Content related to your Tokens.
              You bear responsibility for verifying the legitimacy, authenticity, and legality of the Tokens that you
              purchase from users on our Services. We cannot guarantee that any Tokens visible on our Services will
              always remain visible and/or available.
              <h1 className="text-lg mt-4">5.1.3.</h1> These Terms solely govern the use of our Services. Tokens are
              available on public blockchains and may be purchased, sold, or transferred by buyers, sellers, or creators
              without the use of our Services and therefore without agreeing to our Terms.
              <h1 className="text-lg mt-4">5.1.4.</h1> The value of a Token is determined by the bonding curve
              mechanism, which may result in the value increasing or decreasing based on the amount of tokens bought or
              sold. Bonsai does not control and is not responsible for the value of Tokens and makes no guarantee,
              express or implied, of its value or its graduation to standard token status.
              <h1 className="text-lg mt-4">5.1.5.</h1> You may not use, acquire, sell, or distribute Tokens except
              through the Services and except as expressly allowed by Bonsai under these Terms. Any attempt to do so
              constitutes a violation of the Terms, will render the transaction void, and may result in the immediate
              suspension or termination of your Account and your loss to your claim to the Token's value through the
              Services.
              <h1 className="text-lg mt-4">5.1.6.</h1> Tokens are not legal tender, backed by any government, or subject

              should not be perceived as one.

              If you receive a notification from Bonsai that material made available by you on or through the Services
              has been the subject of a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then you will have the right to provide
              Bonsai with what is called a "Counter Notification." To be effective, a Counter Notification must be in
              writing, provided to Bonsai's Designated Agent through one of the methods identified in Section 11.2 (DMCA
              Notification), and include substantially the following information: § your physical or electronic
              signature; § identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and
              the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled; § a
              statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or
              disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and § your
              name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal
              District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if you are residing outside
              of the United States, then for any judicial district in which Bonsai may be found, and that you will
              accept service of process from the person who provided notification under Section 9.2 (DMCA Notification)
              above or an agent of that person. A party submitting a Counter Notification should consult a lawyer or see
              17 U.S.C. § 512 to confirm the party's obligations to provide a valid counter notification under the
              Copyright Act.
              <h1 className="text-xl mt-4">11.6. Reposting of Content Subject to a Counter Notification</h1>
              If you submit a Counter Notification to Bonsai in response to a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then
              Bonsai will promptly provide the person who provided the Notification of Claimed Infringement with a copy
              of your Counter Notification and inform that person that Bonsai will replace the removed User Content or
              cease disabling access to it in ten (10) business days, and Bonsai will replace the removed User Content
              and cease disabling access to it not less than ten (10), nor more than fourteen (14), business days
              following receipt of the Counter Notification, unless Bonsai's Designated Agent receives notice from the
              party that submitted the Notification of Claimed Infringement that such person has filed an action seeking
              a court order to restrain the user from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on
              Bonsai's system or network.

              The Copyright Act provides at 17 U.S.C. § 512(f) that: "[a]ny person who knowingly materially
              misrepresents under [Section 512 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512)] (1) that material or activity is
              infringing, or (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, will
              be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys' fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any
              copyright owner or copyright owner's authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such
              misrepresentation, as the result of Bonsai relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling
              access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or
              ceasing to disable access to it." Bonsai reserves the right to seek damages from any party that submits a
              Notification of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notification in violation of the law.

              THE CLAIM. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY EVEN IF THE ABOVE STATED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL
              PURPOSE. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential
              damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. Some jurisdictions also limit
              disclaimers or limitations of liability for personal injury from consumer products, so this limitation may
              not apply to personal injury claims.
              <h1 className="text-2xl mt-4">17. Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration</h1>
              <h1 className="text-xl mt-4">17.1. Generally.</h1>
              Except as described in Section 17.2 (Exceptions) and 17.3 (Opt-Out), you and Bonsai agree that every
              dispute arising in connection with these Terms, the Services, or communications from us will be resolved
              through binding arbitration. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, is less
              formal than a court proceeding, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very
              limited review by courts. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims whether based in
              contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a
              claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. Any dispute relating to the interpretation,
              applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement will be resolved by the arbitrator.
              YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU AND BONSAI ARE EACH
              WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
              <h1 className="text-xl mt-4">17.2. Exceptions.</h1>
              Although we are agreeing to arbitrate most disputes between us, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to
              waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (i) bring an individual action in small
              claims court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if
              that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (iv) to
              file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.
              <h1 className="text-xl mt-4">17.3. Opt-Out.</h1>
              If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this
              Section 17 (Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration) within 30 days after the date that you agree to these
              Terms by sending a letter to Bonsai Labs, Inc., Attention: Legal Department – Arbitration Opt-Out, 110
              Green Street, #803A, New York, NY 10012, that specifies: your full legal name, the email address
              associated with your account on the Services, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration
              ("Opt-Out Notice"). Once Bonsai receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 17 (Dispute Resolution; Binding
              Arbitration) will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in
              Section 18 (Governing Law). The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out
              Notice.
              <h1 className="text-xl mt-4">17.5. Commencing Arbitration.</h1>
              Before initiating arbitration, a party must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party
              by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not
              provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice of Arbitration”). Bonsai’s address
              for Notice is: Bonsai Labs, Inc., 110 Green Street, #803A, New York, NY 10012. The Notice of Arbitration
              must: (i) identify the name or account number of the party making the claim; (ii) describe the nature and
              basis of the claim or dispute; and (iii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will
              make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do
              so within thirty (30) days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Bonsai may commence an
              arbitration proceeding. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Bonsai will reimburse
              you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than US$10,000 or if Bonsai has
              received 25 or more similar demands for arbitration, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided
              by the JAMS Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the claim or the relief sought in
              the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in
              Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules
              and the other party may seek reimbursement for any fees paid to JAMS.
              <h1 className="text-xl mt-4">17.6. Arbitration Proceedings.</h1>
              Any arbitration hearing will take place in the county and state of your residence unless we agree
              otherwise or, if the claim is for US$10,000 or less (and does not seek injunctive relief), you may choose
              whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the
              arbitrator; (ii) through a telephonic or video hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by
              the JAMS Rules in the county (or parish) of your residence. During the arbitration, the amount of any
              settlement offer made by you or Bonsai must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator
              makes a final decision and award, if any. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted,
              the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and
              conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.
              <h1 className="text-xl mt-4">17.7. Arbitration Relief.</h1>
              Except as provided in Section 17.8 (Class Actions Waiver), the arbitrator can award any relief that would
              be available if the claims had been brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator awards
              you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by Bonsai before an arbitrator was
              selected, Bonsai will pay to you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator and (ii)
              US$10,000. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding on all parties, except (1) for judicial
              review expressly permitted by law or (2) if the arbitrator’s award includes an award of injunctive relief
              against a party, in which case that party shall have the right to seek judicial review of the injunctive
              relief in a court of competent jurisdiction that shall not be bound by the arbitrator’s application or
              conclusions of law. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
              <h1 className="text-xl mt-4">17.8. Class Actions Waiver.</h1>
              YOU AND BONSAI AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY
              AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further,
              unless both you and Bonsai agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s
              claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
              <h1 className="text-xl mt-4">17.9. Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.</h1>
              If Bonsai makes any substantive change to this arbitration provision, you may reject the change by sending
              us written notice within thirty (30) days of the change to Bonsai’s address for Notice of Arbitration, in
              which case your account with Bonsai will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in
              effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.
              <h1 className="text-xl mt-4">17.10. Enforceability.</h1>
              If Section 17.8 (Class Actions Waiver) or the entirety of this Section 17 (Dispute Resolution; Binding
              Arbitration) is found to be unenforceable, or if Bonsai receives an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the
              entirety of this Section 17 (Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration) will be null and void and, in that
              case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 18 (Governing Law) will govern any action
              arising out of or related to these Terms.
              <h1 className="text-2xl mt-4">18. Governing Law</h1>
              Any Claims will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of
              Delaware, except to the extent preempted by U.S. Federal Law, without regard to conflict of law rules or
              principles (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
              of the laws of any other jurisdiction. If any Claim is not subject to arbitration pursuant to Section 17,
              then the state and federal courts located in the State of Delaware will have exclusive jurisdiction. You
              and Bonsai waive any objection to venue in any such courts. If your local law requires that consumer
              contracts be interpreted subject to local law and enforced in the courts of that jurisdiction, this
              section may not apply to you only to the extent that local law conflicts with this section.
              <h1 className="text-2xl mt-4">19. Term and Termination</h1>
              <h1 className="text-xl mt-4">19.1. Term</h1>
              These Terms are effective beginning when you accept the Terms or first download, install, access, or use
              the Services and ending when terminated as described in Section 19.2 (Termination).
              <h1 className="text-xl mt-4">19.2. Termination</h1>
              If you violate any provision of these Terms, then your authorization to access the Services and these
              Terms will automatically terminate. Without limiting any other provision of these Terms, we reserve the
              right to, in our sole discretion and without notice or liability, deny access to and use of the Services
              (including blocking certain IP or device addresses), to any person for any reason or for no reason,
              including without limitation for breach of any representation, warranty, or covenant contained in these
              Terms or of any applicable law or regulation. We may terminate your use or participation in the Services

              <h1 className="text-xl mt-4">19.3. Effect of Termination</h1>
              Upon termination of these Terms: (i) your license rights will terminate and you must immediately cease all
              use of the Services; (ii) you will no longer be authorized to access your account or the Services; (iii)
              you must pay Bonsai any unpaid amount that was due prior to termination; and (iv) all payment obligations
              accrued prior to termination, all definitions, and Sections 6 (Ownership; Proprietary Rights), 7.1
              (Limited License Grant to Bonsai), 7.2 (Specific Rules for Photographs and Images), 7.4 (User Content
              Disclaimer), 13 (Indemnification), 14 (Disclaimers; No Warranties by Bonsai), 16 (Limitations of
              Liability), 17 (Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration), 19.3 (Effect of Termination), and 25
              (Miscellaneous) will survive. You are solely responsible for retaining copies of any User Content you Post
              to the Services since upon termination of your account, you may lose access rights to any User Content you
              Posted to the Services. If we terminate or suspend your account for any reason, you are prohibited from
              registering and creating a new account under a new wallet, even if you may be acting on behalf of the
              third party. In addition to terminating or suspending your account, we reserve the right to take
              appropriate legal action, including without limitation pursuing civil, criminal, and injunctive redress.
              <h1 className="text-2xl mt-4">20. Severability</h1>
              If any term, clause, or provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, then that term, clause,
              or provision will be severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any
              remaining part of that term, clause, or provision, or any other term, clause, or provision of these Terms.
              <h1 className="text-2xl mt-4">21. Injunctive Relief</h1>
              You agree that a breach of these Terms will cause irreparable injury to Bonsai for which monetary damages
              would not be an adequate remedy and Bonsai shall be entitled to equitable relief in addition to any
              remedies it may have hereunder or at law without a bond, other security, or proof of damages.
              <h1 className="text-2xl mt-4">22. California Residents</h1>

              information or materials provided by Bonsai hereunder, to any country for which the United States or any
              other relevant jurisdiction requires any export license or other governmental approval at the time of
              export without first obtaining such license or approval. In particular, but without limitation, the
              Services may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any U.S. embargoed countries or any country that has
              been designated by the U.S. Government as a "terrorist supporting" country, or (b) to anyone listed on any

              <h1 className="text-2xl mt-4">24. Survival</h1>
              All sections which by their nature should survive the termination of these Terms shall continue in full
              force and effect subsequent to and notwithstanding any termination of these Terms by Bonsai or you.

              without the prior written consent of Bonsai, and Bonsai's failure to assert any right or provision under
              these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. No waiver by either party of any
              breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or
              default. The section headings used herein are for reference only and shall not be read to have any legal
              effect. Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the
